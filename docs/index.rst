Introducing **COMPAS XR**, an open-source framework designed to streamline extended
reality (XR) workflows. COMPAS XR facilitates the integration of human-machine
collaboration in architectural research and educational environments, enhancing
productivity and innovation in these fields. Additionally, it provides implementation
of communication protocols for both CAD softwares and Unity Based phone applications
required for the visualization, reading, writing, and storage of COMPAS data
across multiple cloud-based data storage formats.

**Key Features:**

* **Multi-User/Device Connectivity:** COMPAS XR features a distributed system that enables numerous users to connect simultaneously and actively share information across all devices. This capability facilitates the implementation of real-time building processes in CAD software, ensuring seamless collaboration and data exchange.
* **Human-Machine Building Assistance:** COMPAS XR enhances assembly tasks through extended reality visualization and interaction features, allowing users to instruct, modify, and record task completions. Additionally, it supports the remote visualization, review, and approval of robotic actions in assembly processes from multiple user devices.
* **Versatility:** COMPAS XR offers robust capabilities for visualizing, planning, and tracking of COMPAS assemblies across a variety of geometries. It supports the extended reality instruction of diverse construction assembly types, catering to a wide range of building procedures.
* **Project-Specific and Low-Code:** COMPAS XR empowers users to tailor assembly processes to meet specific project needs, offering flexibility and ease of use with low-code customization options.

Join us in unlocking the potential of COMPAS XR – where extended reality transforms collaborative
architectural design and research, seamlessly integrating human-machine interaction with
cutting-edge cloud-based solutions and assembly processes.

**AR Timber Assembly** |
Enabling Human-Robot Cooperation for Reconfigurable Timber Assembly

https://robarch2024.org/Collaborative-Augmented-Assembly
https://huma-labforadvancedtechnologyinarch.github.io/robarch24/

In this workshop, participants explored a cooperative human-robot design-to-assembly
workflow, creating a complex timber structure that neither could achieve alone. Using
a digital design tool guided by human input, they modeled the timber assembly, considering
fabrication constraints, structural stability, and task distribution between humans and
robots. During assembly, two mobile robots positioned timber members and provided temporary
support at critical points. Human participants manually closed the reciprocal frames and
added mechanical connectors. Both shared a digital-physical workspace, with humans receiving
instructions via a mobile AR interface, utilizing COMPAS XR features.

The interdisciplinary seminar "Computational Design and Digital Fabrication" aims to bridge fundamental
principles of geometric computation and structural design and use these insights to develop new algorithms
and tools for robotic fabrication in architecture. At the interface of the disciplines of architecture,
structural design and engineering, and digital fabrication, students are taught innovative computational
design solutions for advanced digital construction techniques at various scales.

**ARC 595** | Embodied Computation

https://huma-labforadvancedtechnologyinarch.github.io/ARC596_Embodied-Computatio

The seminar Embodied Computation at Princeton University delves into the intersection of architecture and
computation, focusing on augmented design and fabrication processes. The course is based on lectures and
practical programming exercises in which students learn concepts and methods of computer-aided design,
augmented reality (AR) and digital fabrication. The students learn new programming skills to develop augmented
reality applications for architects to support adaptive and interactive design and fabrication methodologies.
