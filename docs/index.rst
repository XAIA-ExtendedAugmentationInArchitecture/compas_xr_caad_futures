Introducing **COMPAS XR**, an open-source framework designed to streamline extended
reality (XR) workflows. COMPAS XR facilitates the integration of human-machine
collaboration in architectural research and educational environments, enhancing
productivity and innovation in these fields. Additionally, it provides implementation
of communication protocols for both CAD softwares and Unity Based phone applications
required for the visualization, reading, writing, and storage of COMPAS data
across multiple cloud-based data storage formats.
